because this is one of the first few project that i started.

it didn't really have a standard versioning scheme.

whenever a rewrite is done, the version increment

v1: just a bunch of code mash together, a single while loop, only one site supported
v2: functions (`def`) was added xD
v3: class was added xD
v4: a partial rewrite, first try at dynamic import system (without __import__)
